## An effort to complete my M.Sc. thesis

## Description:
## A filter will be designed that removes thermal drift in images/movies obtained 
## through Backscattered Scanning Electron Microscopy.

## Stages:
## 1. Take a fork of or download the Artimagen artificial scanning charged particle image generation 
## package and update to run on Python 3+.
## 2. Generate a series of artificial scanning electron micropscopy images (between 1500 
## - 10000) with caclulated variation due to thermal drift.
## 3. Design a neural network that uses several physical phenomena as variables for the 
## creation of the perceptron.
## 4. Train/test the NN on the artificially generated images.
## 5. Apply the optimised NN on the experimentally obtained BSE images/movies.
